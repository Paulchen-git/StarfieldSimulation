# Starfield Simulation

Welcome to the Starfield Simulation project! This project simulates a starfield effect, creating the illusion of speed in the space (like in Star Wars).

## Features

- Starfield effect
- Adjustable star speed and density

## Installation

Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Paulchen-git/StarfieldSimulation.git
    ```

## Usage

Everything has been coded on VS Code.
To start the simulation, run the following file: MainClass.java

## Configuration

You can customize the simulation by modifying some files. Here are some of the available options:

- `numStars`: Number of stars in the simulation (in MainClass.java)
- `SPEED`: Speed at which the stars move (in StarfieldSimulation.java). If you set a speed above 10, it won't be very smooth.
